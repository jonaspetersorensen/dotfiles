# dotfiles

Simple dotfile repo for my short lived ubuntu installations.  
That said, this repo is more for misc install instructions, as a pure dotfile repo where I simply copy the same dotfiles to new installs does
not always work that well for me due to the particulars of any given system and use case.

## How to customize .bashrc

All custom settings are stored in a separate file `.bashrc_extras` in order to keep `.bashrc` as clean and default as possible (quite handy when handling lots of installs).

1. Open `.bashrc` in an editor
1. At the bottom of the file, add the following and save  
   NB! Make sure the path is correct for your system.
   ```sh
   ### Extras
   . ~/dev/dotfiles/configs/.bashrc_extras
   ```
1. Restart shell
1. Done!


## SSH

I use [keychain](https://www.funtoo.org/Funtoo:Keychain) for easier management of ssh keys.  
Install and settings are handled by default install and bashrc extras.

1. Copy keys to `~/.ssh`
1. Set permissions: run script `. ./scripts/set-ssh-permissions.sh`
1. Done!
