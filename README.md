# dotfiles

Simple dotfile repo for my short lived ubuntu installations.  
That said, this repo is more for misc install instructions, as a pure dotfile repo where I simply copy the same dotfiles to new installs does
not always work that well for me due to the particulars of any given system and use case.

## Base installation
1. Update to latest: `. ./scripts/update-all.sh`
1. Install default tools: run script `. ./scripts/install-defaults.sh`
1. Add custom settings to `.bashrc`, see [instructions](#how-to-customize-bashrc)
1. [Add ssh keys](#how-to-manage-ssh)
1. (WSL) [Install pretty shell](./oh-my-posh.md)
1. [Install tmux](./tmux.md)  
   1. Then copy config file `./configs/.tmux.conf` to `~/.tmux.conf`

Languages:
- [Install rust](./rust.md)

## How to customize .bashrc

All custom settings are stored in a separate file `.bashrc_extras` in order to keep `.bashrc` as clean and default as possible (quite handy when handling lots of installs).

1. Open `.bashrc` in an editor
1. At the bottom of the file, add the following and save  
   NB! Make sure the path is correct for your system.
   ```sh
   ### Extras
   . ~/dev/dotfiles/configs/.bashrc_extras
   ```
1. Restart shell
1. Done!


## How to manage ssh

I use [keychain](https://www.funtoo.org/Funtoo:Keychain) for easier management of ssh keys.  
Install and settings are handled by default install and bashrc extras.

1. Copy keys to `~/.ssh`
1. Set permissions: run script `. ./scripts/set-ssh-permissions.sh`
1. Done!


## Graphics and CUDA support

### Works out of the box

- [Run Linux GUI apps on the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps)  
  Graphics are enabled via [WSLg] by default on win 11. It use a vGPU behinds the sceen and then open a window on the host via FreeRDP.

### Require installation

#### x11
- `sudo apt install x11-xserver-utils` so you can use things like `xhost`

#### CUDA

**DO NOT** follow the install instructions as described in MS docs [Get started with GPU acceleration for ML in WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gpu-compute), they are outdated.  
Go to Nvidia for updated instructions (see below).  
The main challenge with CUDA on WSL is that the default Ubuntu package for CUDA Toolkit comes with a driver. This driver will overwrite the link to the windows driver. The solution is to install a WSL-Ubuntu specific package for CUDA toolkit directly from Nvidia.

1. Follow the manual installation steps in nvidia doc [CUDA on WSL](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#getting-started-with-cuda-on-wsl)
   1. Remove old key as instructed
   1. Then run "Option 1: Installation of Linux x86 CUDA Toolkit using WSL-Ubuntu Package â€“ Recommended"
   1. Done!
   
If you later get the error message `libcuda.so.1 is not a symbolic link` then you fix this in windows as described [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5663#issuecomment-1068499676)


##### Docker + CUDA
1. Docker should work with CUDA out of the box with the latest version of Docker installed on win11 as described in [WSL 2 GPU Support for Docker Desktop on NVIDIA GPUs](https://www.docker.com/blog/wsl-2-gpu-support-for-docker-desktop-on-nvidia-gpus/)
1. You can verify CUDA installation by running the examples found in the page above, or simply run CUDA benchmark like so:  
   ```sh
   docker run -it --gpus=all --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/cuda-sample:nbody nbody -benchmark
   ```

Note that the parameter `--gpus=all` is the way to tell docker to use gpu, otherwise it will just use the cpu.

You should not need to install nvidia container toolkit.  
The internetz says it has hardcoded dependencies on x11 versions and driver versions which will turn into a mess.

##### docker-compose + CUDA

To enable gpus then define gpu as a capability under the `deploy` tag.  
[docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gpu-support/)

```sh
# Example docker-compose.yaml

demo:
   build: something
   command: something
   deploy:
      resources:
         reservations:
            devices:
               - capabilities: [gpu]
```


## Docker

### Docker desktop failed to stop

Sometimes installs in wsl (like nvidia-container-tools) can mess up the docker wsl distro which will set docker in a bad state.  

Fix:
1. Close docker desktop
1. Unregister the docker wsl distro: 
   1. In windows, open a cmd as admin and run `wslconfig.exe /u docker-desktop`
1. Start docker desktop


## Compacting to free up space

WSL2 lives inside a virtual disk which is usually stored by windows in a `ext4.vhdx` file.  
This file will grow over time even if contents inside WSL2 are deleted. This "feature" is one of the small quirks of virtual file systems, they tend to eat up space on the host system usage over time goes up.  
You can reclaim this space by trimming the `.vhdx` file.
